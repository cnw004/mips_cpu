 ## Directory Structure
 - `src/`: Holds all of our module files that need to be included for the processor to be compiled
 - `docs/`: Holds team contract and work plan as well as any supporting documentation not found as comments in the modules.
 - `test/`: Holds all of our files used to test our processor. This includes our unit test benches as well as tests such as hello.v, jump.v, and add_test.v that were crucial parts of testing our processor.
 - `./`: The parent directory. This holds our README.md (so it shows on our github page), our wired together processor, and some supporting files needed to compile said processor. This folder also contains the script `run` which is used to compile and run our processor.

## Compilation and Execution
To run and compile, navigate to the main directory and run `./run`. This compiles our processor to a file called `output` and then runs `output`. Right now our processor is set to run hello.v. If you wish to run a different file on our processor, navigate into src/instruction_memory and change the filename in `readmemh(<filename>, memory);` to the name of the file you wish to pull instruction from. To ensure this fully works the .v file that you are feeding into `readmemh` must be in the parent directory.

## Block Diagrams

### Top Level

This image is was created to show a very high level of how our modules connect to one another. Each of the modules between the registers are our mid-level modules and encapsulate all other lower level modules that are inside of their respective stages. This greatly helped us keep sanity when wiring these together. As you can see, most modules are connected to hazards either providing inputs or outputs. The registers are the only clocked modules and act as drivers of our system.

### Syscall
![alt text](https://github.com/cnw004/mips_cpu/blob/feature/whitley/update-readme/img/syscall.png "Syscall")

This diagram was created to display how we implement syscalls. We decided to execute syscalls inside of the writeback stage. In order to make this happen we send syscall_in (our control signal for syscall) and instruction_in (our raw instruction) through all of our registers to ensure proper timing going into syscall. Both v0 and a0 go directly from registers into syscall (skipping all of the clocking). While this may seem odd, we do this because we want to ensure that we have the most up to date values stored in these registers.


### Forward Mem to Mem
![alt text](https://github.com/cnw004/mips_cpu/blob/feature/whitley/update-readme/img/forwardMM.png "Forward Mem to Mem")

This diagram was created to demonstrate how we implement mem to mem forwarding. This type of forwarding was not explicitly explained in the book, nor was it shown on the initial diagram. We pass the value of Rt through regM so that we have the value of it in the memory stage, and then pass that into the hazard unit. The forwardMM signal is generated by comparing the Rt register in the writeback stage to the Rt register in the memory stage. If they are the same, we are writing to a register in the writeback stage, and we are writing to memory in the memory stage, we will need to forward the data that was going to written in the writeback stage to the memory stage.


## Design Features

### Mid-level Modules
Our approach to this problem was fairly unique. Instead of wiring each individual module together into our single, large system we decided to make mid-level modules for each of the individual stages. This allowed us to abstract some of the complexity of wiring everything together. We have one module each for fetch, decode, execute, memory, and writeback. Inside each of those modules are other modules that are internal to those blocks. This made it so we had far fewer modules to handle in our pipeline_overview.v file. There are a few more than just these five modules because of the way that we decided to organize each of the mid-level modules.

### Wire Naming Conventions
In making some of our larger modules (with many inputs and outputs) we decided to name them in1, in2, ... and out1, out2, ... In hindsight, this was a poor design decision. Due to this error, part way through our implementation we had to go through multiple files and fully rename these variables so that it was more readable. This made debugging and reading our code much more manageable.

### Overview Naming Conventions
In pipeline_overview.v we used a naming convention that made the file incredibly readable. Each wire declared is named in the following way: `<STAGE>_in_<REFERENCE_VAR>`. For example, the fetch stage has an input to tell if the instruction is a jump or not called `fetch_in_jump`. This convention makes this file incredibly readable while also making it clear which input connects to which output.

### Print String
When implementing helloworld we decided that we would need to handle the printing of the string inside of instruction memory (outside of system_call). This is due to the fact that we need to access instruction memory in order to handle syscalls. So, instead of passing instruction memory into the syscall module, we pass the value of a0 (which represents the index of the beginning of the string in memory) and a print_string signal into instruction memory and handled it all there.

## Testing Methodology

### Test Benches
We utilized small test benches (almost like unit tests) to test some of our individual modules. This allowed us to ensure that each individual module was working properly before we stitched them all together into one large system. These tests were written mainly for modules that we had to alter or modules that we found to be more error prone than others. Some modules were taken from our last project and had already been tested, so individual test benches were not written for these.

### GTKWave
GTKWave was heavily leveraged in the testing of our system. After putting all of the pieces together, we decided to run add_test in order to test our system. We began by running add_test and following the instructions through our pipeline. By analyzing GTKWave we were able to see where and when instructions went amok. This allowed us to fix our processor and get it to a working state before adding in additional functionality for helloworld and other programs.

In the case of helloworld we heavily leveraged GTKWave to let us know which signals were getting confused or crossed. This allowed us to isolate modules where errors occurred, greatly speeding up the debugging process.

### Displays
Oftentimes we place `$display` throughout our code in order to see the value of certain variables as our code ran. Frequently this was very similar to what we would see in GTKWave, however it could be more readable and made quick fixes much easier. For example, we used this heavily when implementing helloworld in order to inspect the values stored in a0 and v0. We could have just used GTKWave, but running our file and seeing outputs without having to leave terminal was found to be helpful.
